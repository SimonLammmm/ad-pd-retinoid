# Systems analysis reveals ageing-related perturbations in retinoids and sex hormones in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases

## Abstract

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) including Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD) are complex heterogeneous diseases with highly variable patient response to treatment. Due to the growing evidence for ageing-related clinical and pathological commonalities between AD and PD, these diseases have been studied in tandem. In this study, we analyse transcriptomic data of AD and PD, and stratify these patients into three subclasses with distinct gene expression and metabolic profile. Through integrating transcriptomics data with the genome-scale metabolic modelling and validating our findings in a zebrafish ageing model, we identify retinoids as an ageing-related key feature in all subclasses of AD and PD. We also demonstrate that the dysregulation of androgen metabolism by three different independent mechanisms is a source of heterogeneity in AD and PD. Taken together, our work highlights the need for stratification of AD/PD patients and development of a personalised and precision medicine approach based on the detailed characterisation of these subclasses.
