### Subset counts across organs

subsetCts <- function(cts, colData, organSel, strainSel) {
    colData <- colData %>%
        filter(part == organSel) %>%
        filter(tert1 == strainSel)

    cts %>%
        dplyr::select(entrezgene_id, colData$sample)
}


### Calculate mean counts

meanCts <- function(subsetCts) {
    cbind(subsetCts$entrezgene_id, rowMeans(subsetCts[,2:length(subsetCts)])) %>%
        as.data.frame()
}
